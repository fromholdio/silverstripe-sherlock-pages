# silverstripe-sherlock-pages

A usage/implementation example of fromholdio/silverstripe-sherlock.

This is intended more as an example in lieu of documentation for [fromholdio/silverstripe-sherlock](https://github.com/fromholdio/silverstripe-sherlock).

Apologies, I haven't had the chance to write much documentation for this yet. See the source of the above-referenced module, or submit an issue with any question you may have in the meantime.
